# Highlights
### 1: Flexible for Updates
As my skills and projects grow quickly, I need to update my portfolio website accordingly. However, I donâ€™t want to spend a lot of time reviewing, updating and redeploying the code from time to time. So instead of a static website, I established a backend platform to manage the updates of contents.All contents are flexible to be updated and modified through backend content platform. 
### 2: User Responsive
In order to improve the quality of the website and user experience, I added a lot of animations and interactions. So the website is of good-looking and fully user responsive. It is also responsive to the changes in the screen size, so it look good on all the devices, like desktops, laptops, iPads, mobile phones.
### 3: Higher Order Components
I used react higher order components to wrap each section to make them have similar features, such as navigation dots on the right side, social media icons on the left bottom, and copyright info on the right bottom. I also wrapped them with motion wrap for animations when scrolling the web pages.
